Each row is about 60 characters wide. A line that has been
broken in two is indicated by a \ (backslash). 


1. Adding new events
--------------------
To add a new event, start by copying one of the files in
`sources\events`. Name it according to the following format:

	17_5_vannationssittning.html.part
	 | |         |            |
	 | |         |             `- The file ending ".html.part"
	 | |         |              
     | |         `-- A lower-case short name for the event
     | |
     | `- Day of the month of the event
     | 
      `-- Month of the event

Edit your file in a text editor. I recommend using a text
editor called Sublime Text. It is free to use and can be found
at www.sublimetext.com. It features syntax highlighting, which
means that the HTML code will be colored to make it easy to
distinguish content from code. Fill in the text (title,
subtitle, text). You should be able to see where they fit in
(the content of each <div> tag).

Try to formulate the contents in sentences, not in tables or
lists. This is so that it can work (be easily viewable) on
the mobile web page.

In `sources\events.html.page` you will need to make an entry
for the calendar. Look at previously added events to see what
the HTML structure is. The text of the event should follow
the format:

	16: Vännationssittning kl 18-02
	 ||         |             `- The time of the event
	 ||          `- The name of the event
	 |`- A colon (:)
	 |
	 `-- Day of the event

Be sure to make a relatively short name for the event, or
it will be difficult to distinguish it among the other
events in the calendar.

Last, if the event should be shown in the "Events" box
on the front page, you should add it there too. The HTML
structure is practically the same and the file can be found
in `sources`: the name of it is `index.html.page`.

The last thing to do is to make a Git commit with your
changes. Make a comment with the name of the event that
you added, for example "Event added: Vännationssittning.".

Push your changes to the `changes` branch on GitHub. Your
changes will be reviewed and approved as soon as possible.
If you have editor status you can make changes on the main
branch directly -- your changes will be published as soon
as the script runs as a result of your change being
committed.


2. Adding content to a HTML file
--------------------------------
When you add HTML content to a page, no text should be left
inside a tag and next to a tag. An example:

	<p t="Här är text.">Here is text. <a t="Länk">Link</a></p>

If you write the content as above, the translation function
will erase the <a> element. You should write it like this:

	<p><span t="Här är text.">Here is text.</span> \
	<a t="Länk">Link</a></p>

The translation function will operate as expected using the
second example.
